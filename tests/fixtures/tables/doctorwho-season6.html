The Doctor travels back to Kazran&apos;s youth and attempts to alter his past to make him kinder, spending time adventuring with young Kazran and a young woman named Abigail, who was released from a [[cryogenic]] chamber as her singing abilities calm the sharks which occupy the atmosphere. However, Abigail was suffering from an incurable disease, and Kazran grows up bitter that she cannot be let out again or she will die; but, the Doctor shows Kazran&apos;s younger self what he would become and he decides to release the ship.

Cleaves refuses to heed the Doctor&apos;s warning about the solar storm until she receives official orders. The Doctor attempts to disconnect the solar connector, but an electrical strike knocks everyone unconscious and have caused the crew&apos;s Gangers to become sentient, and the Gangers are planning on killing the humans.

The Doctor&apos;s Ganger persuades the Gangers to liberate the humans, but they are pursued by Jennifer&apos;s Ganger, who has transformed herself into a monster. The Doctor reveals that Amy was actually distrusting the real version of him, and his Ganger and Cleaves&apos; Ganger stay behind to destroy the monster. Amy begins experiencing contractions, and the Doctor explains she is going into labour and had been replaced by a Ganger which her real self is controlling.

The Doctor&apos;s allies discover that Melody contains both human and Time Lord DNA, a result of her being conceived on the TARDIS on Amy and Rory&apos;s wedding night. As Rory and the rest of the Doctor&apos;s allies battle the [[List of Doctor Who universe creatures and aliens (H-P)#Headless Monks|Headless Monks]], the Doctor learns that he has been tricked: Melody has been replaced by a Ganger duplicate, and he is too late. River Song arrives, communicates her identity to the Doctor and he races off in the TARDIS, promising Amy and Rory that he will get their daughter back.

They accidentally save Hitler, as they disrupted a [[List of Doctor Who creatures and aliens#Teselecta|Teselecta]], a shapeshifting robot piloted by miniaturised people to punish criminals, from killing him. Before Rory locks him away, Hitler shoots at the Teselecta but hits Mels instead. Instead of dying, however, Mels begins to regenerate into another incarnation which they recognise as River Song. She attempts to kill the Doctor several times before she kisses him; he discovers her lipstick was laced with poison that will kill him in 32 minutes. The Teselecta identifies River as responsible for the Doctor&apos;s death and thus a criminal, but Amy and Rory plead they not torture her and turn the Teselecta&apos;s security robots against the crew, who promptly teleport out.

The Doctor asserts that George is an empathic alien who took on the form of Alex and Claire&apos;s desired child through a [[List of Doctor Who items#Perception filter|perception filter]], and has the ability to lock away his fears within the wardrobe. George panics, causing the Doctor and Alex to be sucked into the doll&apos;s house. The Doctor realises that if George faces his fears by opening the wardrobe, the world in the dollhouse will be destroyed. George opens the wardrobe and is surrounded by dolls due to his belief that he is not wanted.

Those infected by the plague are placed in an accelerated time stream, allowing them to live out their lives whilst in communication with their loved ones. Amy accidentally enters one of these rooms and is separated from the Doctor and Rory. The Doctor uses the TARDIS to locate her and Rory leaves to rescue her; the Doctor, who has two hearts, must remain on the TARDIS to avoid catching the plague. However, they have arrived 36 years later in Amy&apos;s time stream and the older Amy refuses to let them rescue her younger self. She later softens, however, and the Doctor says that both versions of Amy will be able to travel on the TARDIS.

One by one, Joe, Howie, and Rita are seemingly possessed by a minotaur-like monster and lured to it and subsequently killed. The Doctor surmises that the minotaur fed on a specific faith each of them had and discovers that Amy will be next, as she has faith in him. He convinces her to break her faith and the monster collapses and the hotel setting is revealed to be part of a simulation taking place on a prison ship.
